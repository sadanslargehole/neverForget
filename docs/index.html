    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <h2>1. Selecting a mode</h2>
    <hr/>

    <strong class="warning">Messages in private channels will be logged by default if you're using blacklist mode and
        those channels are not blacklisted!</strong>

    <p><b>Whitelist mode</b> makes it so you have to choose channels where unpins are logged. You can mark and un-mark
        channels for logging with <span class="code">`wlist &lt;add | rm&gt; [channelID]</span>.</p>
    <p><b>Blacklist mode</b> makes it so unpins are logged in all channels unless you explicitly mark them as ignored.
        You can mark and un-mark channels to be ignored with <span
                class="code">`blist &lt;add | rm&gt; [channelID]</span>.</p>
    <p>To choose a mode, run <span class="code">`mode set blist</span> for blacklist mode, or <span class="code">`mode set wlist</span>
        for whitelist mode.</p>

    <h2>
        2. Selecting when you want the messages logged
    </h2>
    <hr/>

    <p>By default messages are logged when they are unpinned.</p>
    <p>If you want them logged when they are pinned instead, you can set the bot to log when they are pinned instead</p>
    <p>To do this run <span class="code">`mode time &lt;pin | unpin&gt;</span></p>
    <h2>3. Setting up a logging channel</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>To automatically set up a logging channel, run <span class="code">`log setup</span>. This will automatically
        create a log channel with the following defaults.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>@everyone will not be allowed to send messages</li>
        <li>Any role with Manage Messages, Manage Server or Manage Channels will be able to send messages</li>
        <li>The name <span class="code">#pinned-messages-log</span> will be set by default</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can change the name, permissions, anything you like, as long as the channel is not deleted. If you'd prefer
        to use your own pre-existing channel, run <span class="code">`log set [channelID]</span>.</p>
    <h2>4. Enable the bot</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>Run <span class="code">`enable</span>.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>The default prefix is <span class="code">`</span>. If you're self-hosting and have a custom prefix set, use that
        instead.</p>
